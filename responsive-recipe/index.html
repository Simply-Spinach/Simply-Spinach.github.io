        <h1>Traditional Style Gyro Meat made at home</h1>
        <section class="body">
            <p>Gyros are traditionally made from lamb, a combination of lamb and beef, or chicken. The meat is layered
                around the base of a skewer to form a tall, wide cone of tightly packed layers. It's then slow-roasted
                while spinning around a low flame and sliced off when it's time to serve.</p>
            <p>The gyro meat can be eaten as part of a gyro salad, but it's most popular sliced directly from the spit
                and served in a pita sandwich that's so big it's hard to hold in one hand!</p>
            <p>But to make a gyro at home, it's more like making a meat loaf. You process the ground lamb and beef in a
                food processor to create a sort of paste, which will then be baked, weighed down, sliced and seared. By
                searing it, you achieve a crispy outer layer like a rotisserie gyro.</p>

                spot of harissa for a spicy kick to your gyro wraps.</p>
            <p>You can also prepare a spread of other Mediterranean favorites such as falafel, baba ganoush, and whipped
                feta dip. Or for a meal, pair it with some crispy roasted potatoes!</p>
