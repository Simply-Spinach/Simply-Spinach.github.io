        <h1>Traditional Style ONION PURE made at home</h1>
        <section class="body">
            <p> When vampires are rampant, perhaps you want to look at new options for defending yourself. Vampires hate
                onions so might as well start here with enough stock to last you your lifetime </p>
            <p> This is a great treat for many people such as onion lovers, vampire haters, and those who believe onions
                shouldn't be so layered. It's also great as an ingredient in other recipes but we won't go into that
                here.</p>
            <p> Just be careful of your breath after this and avoid going on any dates. </p>

            <p>Prepare onions as explained above</p>
            <p>Pulse the onion in a food processor for 10 to 15 seconds until finely chopped, making sure to scrape down

            <p>Sometimes finely chopped isn't chopped fine enough.</p>

                making sure to scrape down

            <p>Maybe you feel that wasn't enough (I agree), so feel free to repeat step 2 as many times as needed to get

            <p>If you haven't cried yet, you should. This isn't a good recipe and you just wasted a bunch of onions, not

            <p> This doesn't really do anything, this is mostly a test of the design of this website to ensure all
                elements look correct on any screen. The onion story just came up because I copied and pasted a recipe
                from another site and got a lot of cutting onions. I will likely redesign this for a final version with
                a real recipe you can follow for burnt orange cookies if I can get family approval </p>
            <p> Otherwise, this test I would say was pretty successful.  Thank you for reading and hopefully we will get around to making final versions later this semester </p>
