    <h1> Code Log 4: Colors </h1>
    <p> There are a variety of reasons why staring at a black and white web page is boring. For one, black and white is
        kinda hard on the eyes and it's just not that appealing visuals wise and it limits your design choices. Thankfully, CSS has many different
        varieties of color to add to your code. Here are some examples of properties you can use in your code:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            color: Font color
        </li>
        <li>
            background-color: Background color of the box
        </li>
        <li>
            border-color: Color of the border
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        What's the color property good for though if you don't have any colors to set it with? Here are some values you
        can use for color:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span style='color: red'>red</span>/<span style='color: blueviolet'>blueviolet</span>/<span style='color:mediumspringgreen'>mediumspringgreen</span>: named colors build into CSS.
            You can view a list of all of them <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.php">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hexadecimal: Just type <span style='color:#abcdef'>#abcdef</span> or whatever hexadecimal color you want and
            boom! You have your own color!
        </li>
        <li>
            rgb(r, g, b): Gives you a color given the provided rgb values. Range is from 0 to 255 for each value
        </li>
        <li>
            hsl(h ,s, l): Gives you a color based on hue, saturation and lightness. Hue is from 0 to 360 degrees where 0 is red while
            saturation and lightness are measured in percent. Lightness is different from HSV (what you're more likely
            experienced with) in the fact that 0% is black, 50% is your color, and 100% is white.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note that you can also use rgba and hsva to add alpha channels to your colors.  Alpha is measured from 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque).
