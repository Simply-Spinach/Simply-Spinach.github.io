    <h1> Code Log 5: Images </h1>
    <p>Img tags are used to add something different than just text to a webpage. They are comprised of a source or src
        which is absolute or relative to pull an image from the internet and contains alternative text to display upon
        failure to load.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imags are different than background images because they contain an alt text for when they disappear.
        Alt text will replace an image when it's unable to load, like if the user decides to not use images, or for
        screen readers, or some console based browsers like Lynx. This gives imgs a head over background images
        because sometimes context is lost without some images and alt text allows you to add in that context.
    </p>
    <p>
        Background-image works better in situations where you want elements on top of your images. Images cannot contain
        child elements unfortunately.
    </p>
    <p>
        For other ways to set an image using css, try the background property, which allows you to set multiple
        background properties at once.
    </p>
    <p>
        To modify your background-images, you can use options like background-repeat to enable or disable repeating.
        You can also use background-position to change how it's positioned or background-attachment to attach the
        background image, say to a fixed position so that it doesn't move but the frame moves.  This provides far 
        more opportunities than a regular img can cover, however, also doesn't help anything the img is supposed to be
        used for.
